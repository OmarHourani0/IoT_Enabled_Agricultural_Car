# IoT Enabled Agricultural Car
Welcome to the IoT Enabled Agricultural Car page. This repository houses the source code and documentation for our system. The car is owered by the PIC16F877A microcontroller. What sets our system apart is the fact that it is IoT-enabled, this allows users to monitor and control the system without being physically there. It will help farmers track the environment of their land remotely, this is extremely useful for them and would save them alot of time and money. The repository includes the PIC16F877A source code, hardware specifications, and documentation.
